# toolauth

A simple server to handle integration of a tool authorization system with custom curcuit boards. 
Designed by and for use at MakeHaven in New Haven, CT.

# getting started
initiate a new copy of the database:
    "poetry run init_db"

start up the server:
    "poetry run start"

## things to get help on:
* JS to make the update buttons work: convert data to input boxes, then on second button press: actually update DB
